# Sparklight Offer Management System

A lightweight internal tool for tracking Sparklight promotional offers, disclaimers, and proof uploads. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new offers with all key fields
- Automatically track required disclaimers (Fiber, eero/Plume, Ookla)
- Upload final creative proofs
- Export all offers to CSV
- Clean and responsive UI using vanilla HTML/CSS

## 🧠 How It Works
Each new entry adds a row to the table. You can export all data to a CSV for record-keeping or review.

## 🧩 Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sparklight-offer-manager.git
   cd sparklight-offer-manager
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. To host publicly, enable **GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Set source to `main` branch, `/root`
   - Save and view your live site

## 🪄 Optional Enhancements
- Connect to Firebase or Airtable for multi-user persistence

- Add audit log for version tracking
